# InceptionV3_Optimization_with_TensorRT

Optimization of pre-trained InveptionV3 network with imagenet weights with the help of Nvidia TensorRT engine.

Tensorflow model was converted to TF-TRT graphs with precision modes FP32 , FP16 , and INT8.
The optimization resulted in an increase in throughput by 210%.
